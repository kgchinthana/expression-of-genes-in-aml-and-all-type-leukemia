# Expression of Genes in AML and ALL Type Leukemia

This project focuses on classifying **Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML)** and **Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL)** using microarray gene expression data. It combines supervised machine learning models, unsupervised clustering, PCA-based dimensionality reduction, and explainability methods such as SHAP.

## 🧬 Methodology Overview

1. **Data Preprocessing** – Cleaned, transposed, and labeled.
2. **Model Training** – Logistic Regression and Random Forest gave highest accuracy (0.824).
3. **Dimensionality Reduction** – PCA for top component analysis.
4. **Clustering** – KMeans and Agglomerative showed highest purity (0.737).
5. **Interpretability** – SHAP and decision trees provided gene-level insights.
